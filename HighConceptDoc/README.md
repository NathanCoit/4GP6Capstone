## Short Description
Every god has worshippers. You’re an aspiring god that wants to have every person on the planet worship you. The only thing that stands in your way are the other, more powerful gods. In order to expand your influence, you must meticulously manage your resources, worshipers and your city to prepare to declare war on rival godly villages. 

The game will host two modes of gameplay; in combat and out of combat. In combat, you will play as your god in a turn based battle against an enemy god. Both your worshippers and the enemy god’s worshippers will also be battling in another grid-like “plane”. Out of combat, you will be building your civilization and improving your city and worshippers. Both modes will be important in progressing further in the game as each is needed in order for the player to be more successful at the other.

Also it should be mentioned that the game title, UnderGods, is a play on words of the term “underdog” and the playable character of this game, a god. As the driving story of the game is starting out as a lowly god and then facing more powerful gods to progress we believe UnderGods to be a very fitting and catchy name.

## Players Role/Goal/Motivation
### Role
The player starts off by choosing a god with a certain power and then plays as that god who oversees villages and their followers in order to progress in the game. The player will be able to control their worshippers in battle however their main role is to exist in the form of their chosen god and controlling their worshippers is just another aspect of their godly abilities.

### Goal
With the player’s chosen starting god, their goal is to try to become the most powerful in the land by gaining followers, defeating other gods, improving their godly powers (through means of a tech/skill tree) and building up their civilizations (by upgrading buildings and their followers). By defeating other gods, the player will expand their territory and will ultimately hope to reign supreme over the world and all its followers.

### Motivation
The player will start off with a low amount of followers and one village. Their main motivation is to defeat other gods, gaining more followers and resources which in turn can make the player more powerful. As well, the player can upgrade their cities, giving them more resources and also allowing them to gain and enhance their followers. As the player gets more powerful, they will be able to continually upgrade and fight higher tier gods which will, in turn, improve upon their godly prowess. The game will have progression systems that will help to spur players on to become the ultimate god and to upgrade their city and powers as best as they possibly can.

## Genre/Theme
The game as a whole fits into the realm of 4X/strategy/management and hence is inspired by many other games with similar genres (main inspirations listed in appropriate section). The main driving genre will be strategy shown throughout the games combat mode, however management plays big role in the non-combat portion of the game where you need to upgrade and maintain your city and followers. Overall, an overarching genre for the game would be 4X. Not all elements of 4X are in this game in their entirety however the concepts of eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate are all going to be existent in their own little way.

## Target Player
The target player for this game is anyone who enjoys modern strategy and 4X games.  UnderGods will draw heavily on these genres, so any fan should deeply enjoy our game. This also assumes that the player has basic knowledge on the skill and strategies needed to play games of these genres.

## Features (Optional)

## Inspiration
This game is inspired by the likes of Civilization, various 4X games and combat-strategy games (such as Hearthstone and Fire Emblem). For example, the city building, upgrading and expansion (or more simply put, the out-of-combat) portion is very much inspired by Civ. Meanwhile, the turn based/grid like combat portion is derived from a combination of Hearthstone where there is a god (our version of their Hero) with followers (our version of their minions) in front and then Fire Emblem with grid like combat with each unit having certain abilities and an attack/move area on grid.


## Unique Selling Point
The unique selling point of UnderGods will be the combination of 4X/RTS and turn based strategy gameplay. Switching between these two types of gameplay will serve to keep both modes fresh and exciting. Goals in both modes will incentivize switching, such as creating more units to succeed in combat, or taking over villages to gain more resources. Additionally, the various characters and personalities that the player encounters will provide entertainment through their humour/dialogue and their character designs. Overall, we believe that the game will combine a variation of exciting gameplay, interesting playability features and fun/unique elements that will enhance general player experience.

## Design Goals

1. Two unique and cohesive gameplay modes - Our game will contain two distinct gameplay modes; A real time strategy/4x mode and a turn based combat mode. These gameplay modes will be linked due to shared resources and benefits between them. The player must succeed in both modes in order to be successful in UnderGods. 
2. Unique gods/factions - Our game will contain several playable gods that will each have unique benefits, drawbacks and units. This allows the player to feel unique from the rest of the AI players and become further immersed in the game.
3. Importance of strategy and resource management - Our game will focus heavily on the players ability to make strategic decisions in combat and their ability to optimally manage their resources out of combat. This provides the player with several unique and interesting challenges.
4. Feeling of progression and growth of power - Throughout a playthrough of our game, the players god and faction with both grow on power and size. This provides a very natural difficulty curve, since as the players power in combat grows, the stakes get higher and as the players faction grows on size it become more difficult to manage. This also provides the player with direct feedback to how they are progressing. If the player is becoming more powerful, they are succeeding.
5. Art style - The general artistic style will reflect a medieval feel with a few graphical specializations depending on where you are in the world. For example if you find yourself in the God of Fire’s village it will have molten lava, red coloured structures, and flames everywhere, as well as a sharp, angry soundtrack to compliment the visual style of fire. The units and weapons will also consistently match with the god’s ability. To further this example the God of Fire’s worshipers will look demonic reddish in appearance with flaming spears and arrows at their disposal. Finally, the God of Fire himself will have visual flames and have special fire powers that can be utilized in battle. 
## Design Overview
### Lore
The world of this game is ruled by gods. The gods of this world have physical manifestations and interact regularly with humans. The god you worship dictates your culture and power in the world. The more popular a god is, the more powerful they are. This leads to many large city states battling to determine who the strongest god is. Many high level gods have lesser gods serving under them creating country like regions. When you start to take over new regions of the world, they will reflect your godliness in such that cities will show what you are the god of. For example, a city that the God of Shoes takes over will change its buildings to reflect the respective power. This will in turn create a feel of a world where battles are constantly raging for territory and how taking over a new area will add to your legacy as a god.

### Characters
You play as an unpopular/lowly god who was “born/created” as the god of something unpopular such as mushrooms, shoes, etc. The more popular gods; God of Fire, God of Water, etc have large legions of followers and taunt you constantly. One day you decide to try and become the number one god in the world. Starting with your small village of worshippers, you plan to conquer the world. The gods are split into three tiers of godhood; High Level, Mid Level, and Low Level. The high level consists of very popular gods that control a very useful/popular domain (God of Fire, God of Water, God of Nature). They are arrogant gods who have been popular since creation. The mid level gods are semi popular gods who control a semi popular domain (God of Hounds, God of Music) and usually serve under a high level god. The unpopular gods have very small areas of influence usually being known by only a single village (God of Mushrooms, God of Shoes). They would usually serve under a mid or high level god. Each god will have their own abilities and culture surrounding them and their power.

### Setting
The setting is on an earth like planet that humans inhabit. The time period is in the early medieval era where technology is around the bronze age. Technology varies greatly between civilizations as the more popular gods have blessed their worshippers with more advanced technologies. The high end civilizations have technology up to the industrial/iron era. Each city’s culture is defined by the god that they worship. Many gods fall under a higher level god and thus adopt some cultural similarities from them. (ie. God of Smiths shares some similarities with God of Fire, God of Mushrooms shares some with God of Nature)
